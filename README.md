main is my working example of the learnopengl.com and
swiftgl.org websites. SwiftGL stopped before the camera
class and learnopengl.com continues in c/c++. Please see
the websites for more information.

Swift is a new language for me and I am still learning
 the language. This is still a work in progress. I
 haven't done a lot of refinement or refactoring.
